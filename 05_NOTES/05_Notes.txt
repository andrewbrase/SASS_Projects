this keyword/ variable : Special variable that is 
created for every execution context (every function).
Takes the value of (points to) the "owner" of the 
function in which the this keyword is used.

this is NOT static. It depends on how the function 
is called, and its value is only assigned when the 
function is actually called.

different ways in which functions can be called
1. as a method - a function attached to an object
Method this = <object that is calling the method>

const andrew = {
    name : 'andrew' ,
    year : 2000 ,
    calcAge : function() {
        return 2022 - this.year;
    }
};

andrew.calcAge();
---> 22

2. simple function call -> this = undefined
this is only valid for strict mode - if not in strict mode,
this will point to the global object - window object

3. Arrow functions -> this = <this of surrounding function 
(lexical this) - it gets picked up by the outer lexical 
scope of the arrow function>

4. event listener -> this = <DOM element that the handler is attached to>


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Method borrowing - taking one method from one obj and adding it to another obj

const dave = {
    name : 'dave' ,
    birthyear : 1965 ,
    calcAge : function () {
        return this.name + ' is ' + (2022 - this.birthyear)
    }
}

//dave.calcAge()
//~~~
 const matilda = {
    name : 'matilda' ,
    birthyear : 2005
 }

matilda.calcAge = dave.calcAge;
matilda.calcAge()

---> matilda is 17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
regular functions vs arrow functions & this

const jonas = {
    firstname : 'jonas' ,
    year : 1991 ,
    calcAge : function() {
        return 2022 - this.year
    } ,

    // trying to use an arrow function using the this keyword 
    greet : () => console.log(`hey ${this.firstname}`)
}

jonas.calcAge()
// ---> 31
jonas.greet()
// ---> hey undefined

*** AN arrow function does not get a THIS 
keyword - the parent scope of the greet method 
is the global scope

this is an object litteral, not a code block - it does
not get its own scope
